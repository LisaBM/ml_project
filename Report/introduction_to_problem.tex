Our main goal is to correctly identify handwritten digits based on the MNIST  ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") data set.
This data set consists of 42000 gray-scale images. Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel \cite{kaggel}.
