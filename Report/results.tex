When choosing ... many training points and .... many testing points our algorithm was correct in ... of the cases. Include things here...?


Linear and Gaussian.

In general ECOC?

Where do we bring in cross validation?

General Conclusions? Difficulties?

We only tried the first approach since as just mentioned the compute time for the second one was simply too high for us considering that we have a very large amount of training data. In the One-vs-All results were very very disappointing. In the case of a linear as well as a Gaussian kernel ... In the linear case this can be explained by the fact that our training data was simply not linearly seperable.
